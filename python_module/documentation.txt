WARNING: This python module is simply a wrapper for calling the
fortran libraries. Because of this, you must setup the folder in the
same way as if you were going to run the fortran codes. This means you
should create the bandmag.dat file, and setup the priors and cosmology
files in the same manner.

######

General

The module is called SED_Model. New objects are created through
lrt_model(). So, to create a new object called "my_galaxy", your code
may look like this:

import SED_Model
my_galaxy = SED_Model.lrt_model()


#######################################################################

Requirements

You must have numpy and matplotlib installed. You can easily get these
with the STScI Ureka software.

Also, you must set your python path to point to the lrt path. In bash
this would look like

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$LRTPATH
export PYTHONPATH

User Provided Attributes

There are 3 attributes that must be provided by the user. These are
the fluxes, the error in the fluxes, and the flags to either use them
or not in the fits. Additionally, the use can also specify the
spectrocopic redshift if known. These attributes are:

self.jy   : numpy array with fluxes in Jy

self.ejy  : numpy array with the flux uncertainties in Jy

self.jyuse: int32 numpy array of the same length as the previous
	    two. A number 1 means use the flux, a number means it is
	    an upper bound, and a number 0 means to not use it int he
	    fit.

self.zspec: Spectroscopic redshift


NOTE: Fluxes must be in THE SAME order as in the bandmag.dat file.

#############

Object Methods

o self.kc_fit()
  Runs the SED modeling. Can only be used if zspec has been specified
  or if zphot is calculated, and self.jy, self.ejy and self.jyuse have
  been specified.

o self.pz_fit()
  Runs the photo-z estimate. Can only be used if self.jy, self.ejy and
  self.jyuse have been specified.

o self.plot()
  Displays plot of the best-fit SED. Only available after running
  kc_fit()

o self.plot_to_file("file_name")
  Instead of displaying the best-fit SED plot, sends the plot to a
  file of name file_name. The extension of file_name determines what
  format the image will be saved as.

o self.get_model_fluxes()
  Model the fluxes for a specified self.comp, self.ebv, self.igm and
  self.zspec or self.zphot. The model fluxes are saved on
  self.jymod. Note that running kc_fit() already sets self.jymod with
  that model fluxes of that best-fit. This method should be used to
  experiment with changing the values of the relevant attributes.

#############

Object Attributes


o self.jymod
  Holds the fluxes of the best-fit SED model. Need to run
  self.kc_fit() or self.get_model_fluxes() populate.

o self.ebv
  Best-fit E(B-V) for the AGN component

o self.igm
  Best-fit strength of the IGM absorption of the best-fit SED.

o self.chi2
  Goodness of fit the SED model through the kc_fit() method.

o self.z0 = 0.
  Redshift to which K-corrections are calculated. Default is 0.

o self.jycorr 
  Observed flux K-corrections. Need to run kc_fit() to populate. 

o self.nchan
  Number of bands (i.e., elements in self.jy)

o self.comp
  Intrinsic luminosity of each template component (see lrt manual for
  details). Need to run self.kc_fit()
 
o self.cov  = None
  Covariance matrix of the self.comp values. Need to run self.kc_fit() 

o self.op   = 0
  op = 0: self.jy are fluxes
  op = 1: self.jy are magnitudes !!NOT SURE CAN BE USED!!

o self.zmin = 0.0
  Redshift grid starting point for photo-z estimation. Default is 0.

o self.zmax = 6.0
  Redshift grid end point for photo-z estimation. Default is 6.0

o self.dz   = 0.01
  Redshift grid spacing. Default is 0.01

o self.chigal 
  chigal value of the pz_fit() method. See pza function in the lrt
  manual.

o self.chinop = None
  chinop value of the pz_fit() method. See pza function in the lrt
  manual.

o self.chi2zop = 0 
  Print or not the P(z) for the target. If ==1, it can be
  dangerous. Default is 0.

o self.zphot
  Photometric redshift. Need to run pz_fit()
  
o self.ahat 
  ahat of the best-fit. See Assef et al.(2013) for exact definition.

o self.iverbose = 0
  Run in verbose mode (1) or not (0). Default is 0.

o self.L6um 
  6um monochromatic luminosity in erg/s.

o self.Mstar 
  Stellar mass in Msun from the g-r/K calibration of Bell et al. (2003).

o self.tempuse = [1,1,1,1] 
  List to set which templates will be use in the SED fit by
  self.kc_fit() (not yet implemented for self.pz_fit()). Each element
  determines a template, such that self.tempuse[i]=0 means that
  template i will not be used and self.tempuse[i]=1 means that it
  will. The numbers are: i=0=AGN, i=1=E, i=2=Sbc and i=3=Im.
